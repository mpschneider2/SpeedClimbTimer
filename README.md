# SpeedClimbTimer

How it should work: holding button 1 for 5 seconds sets the clock to 0, releasing the long hold (onebutton) after the 5 seconds starts the timer
Hitting button 2 should pause the timer and it should blink slowly if not a high score, strobe if a high score. Maybe add a buzzer

it should continue blinking until button 1 is pressed/clicked, where it should then show the high score in solid light.

And a quadruple click should erase the last record if it was made in the same session in which it was plugged in.

and every time a new record is made, in needs to be stored in the EEPROM
